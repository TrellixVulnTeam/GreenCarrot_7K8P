For any application where you are tracking money changing hands, you should
always use a Double Entry Accounting system. Double entry accounting has been
the standard for tracking money for over 500 years. There is no good reason to
use any other method.

This entails a TRANSACTION table and a TRANSACTION_DETAIL table. The transaction
table has one record per transaction that includes header information, like the
date, the total amount, any categorization attributes or relationships, etc.

The transaction detail has two or more records per transaction. These records
break down where the money comes from and goes to. In your case, you might have
three records per transaction. One shows the money coming in from the payment
service. The other two show the money going out to a commission account and to
an income account.

Git tag 'v2' contains the database version that handles orders. That's not required.
